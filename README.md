# Code Refactor Starter Code

The original code contained several non-semantic and redundant code that required revising in order to enhance readability.

## Changes Made

1. Remade HTML code to utilize semantic elements (<header>, <section>) rather than (<div>).
2. Added comments in CSS to improve clarity.
3. Removed redundant code in HTML and CSS for sake of consolidation.
